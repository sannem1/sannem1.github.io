                <h1>A little bit about me.</h1>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Overland Park, Kansas. Growing up, I kept up good grades and read books so much that I would sometimes get in trouble for it. I didnâ€™t initially consider computer science as a career path. However, while applying for colleges and learning about the SELF program, I discovered my passion for programming. Before that, I was interested in pursuing a career in health, but after my first programming class, I knew I was in the right place.

                <h3>What I do now</h3>
                <p>I am currently a third-year computer science student at the University of Kansas. I'm a member of the <a href="https://engr.ku.edu/self-engineering-leadership-fellows-program">SELF Program</a>, a competitive engineering leadership program that focuses on building leadership and management skills. I hold the position of President for the Outreach Committee, and I am in charge of reaching out to schools all over Kansas and advertizing the program. Additionally, I'm part of the <a href="https://business.ku.edu/research-and-faculty/entrepreneurship/catalyst">Catalyst Program</a>, which provides a platform for students to develop their ventures with industry insights. My current venture is an LLC aimed at helping students gain experience through contract work and internships by connecting them with companies.

                    I am also the President of <a href="https://ukansas-wic.github.io">Women In Computing</a> at KU, a club that offers community and professional development opportunities to women in tech. Recently, I spearheaded a new program designed to teach women essential skills that aren't covered in-depth in coursework but are crucial for success in the tech industry. </p>

                <h3>What I used to do</h3>
                <p>This past summer I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.ntst.com/">Netsmart</a>. This was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had as a computer science student and I learned a lot about how to apply the skills I learned at KU to real world scenarios. I have also previously worked at HydroTek Farms, a hydroponics company, where I first learned about Mongo DB, Rest APIS, and React. </p>
